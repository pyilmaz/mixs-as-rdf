#summary htaccess file configuration

To deploy the mixs-as-rdf on the gensc server, we need to handling incoming requests like:

http://gensc.org/ns/mixs/ploidy

and map them to:

http://gensc.org/ns/mixs/index.htm#ploidy

The following is the .htaccess file that is inserted on the gensc server under public_html/ns/mixs to re-write incoming requests. This piece of code is not inserted into the code repository as the system could theoretically be deployed in different environments and have different rewrite needs.
